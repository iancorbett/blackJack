## Configuration

All in blackJack.js:

**Number of decks**

At bottom init:

deck = createDeck(6); // change to 1 or 8, etc.


**Table minimum**
In deal():

let desiredBet = Math.max(5, Number(betEl.value) || 0); // min = 5


**Dealer hits soft 17 (optional)**
Replace the dealer loop in stand() with:

function isSoftHand(cards){
  let total = 0, aces = 0;
  for (const c of cards){ total += valueOf(c); if (c.r === 'A') aces++; }
  while (total > 21 && aces > 0){ total -= 10; aces--; }
  return aces > 0; // at least one Ace still counted as 11
}

while (
  handValue(dealer) < 17 ||
  (handValue(dealer) === 17 && isSoftHand(dealer)) // hit soft 17
) {
  dealer.push(deck.pop());
}

## Architecture Notes

**State machine**

const STATE = { BETTING:'betting', PLAYER:'player', DEALER:'dealer', DONE:'done' };


UI is gated by setButtons() so only valid actions are clickable in each phase.

**Rendering**

renderHands() draws both hands and updates totals

Dealer’s hole card is tracked as hiddenDealerCard; shown via revealHole()

**Persistence**

localStorage.setItem('bankroll', String(bankroll));


Bankroll survives refreshes; Reset Bank sets it back to 1000.

## DOM IDs (must match your HTML)
#bank           #bet            #betDisplay
#status         #dealer         #player
#dealerTotal    #playerTotal    #ruleHint
#deal #hit #stand #double #newRound #resetBank

---

## Status/hint elements

<div class="status" id="status">Place your bet to begin.</div>
<div id="ruleHint" class="hint">Dealer stands on all 17. Blackjack pays 3:2.</div>

---

## Troubleshooting

**“Nothing happens when I click Deal” / cards don’t render**

Open DevTools → Console. If you see
Cannot set properties of null (setting 'textContent')
one of the queried IDs doesn’t exist in your HTML (commonly #status or #ruleHint).

Ensure your JS, CSS, and HTML are in separate files. Don’t paste CSS/HTML into blackJack.js.

Confirm <script src="blackJack.js"></script> matches the actual filename (case-sensitive).

**Dealer didn’t look like they hit**

Make sure you re-render after dealer finishes in stand():

while (handValue(dealer) < 17) dealer.push(deck.pop());
renderHands(); // show final dealer hand
endRound();


If you want to see each hit, render inside the loop with a small delay (async).

**New Round shows cards from the last round**

Clear hands before rendering:

dealer = []; player = []; hiddenDealerCard = null;
renderHands();


**Bankroll doesn’t change**

Check saveBank() is called after payouts and bets.

localStorage can be blocked in some privacy modes.

## Styling

Global tokens in :root (colors/shadows) for easy theming

Cards use .card + .card.red and a faint .big suit “watermark”

Responsive grid switches to two columns for dealer/player at min-width: 860px
